<h1>SoruvaLab</h1>

<p>
SoruvaLab is an independent digital product studio operated
as a sole proprietorship based in Japan.
</p>

<h2>Business Overview</h2>
<p>
We actively sell digital products, including unpublished mobile
application source code, software projects built with Flutter,
and AI infrastructure concepts such as Velior Trust.
</p>

<h2>How Transactions Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One-time payment per product</li>
  <li>Digital delivery after payment (within 1–3 business days)</li>
  <li>No subscriptions or recurring charges</li>
  <li>No physical goods or ongoing services</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each transaction represents a single sale and transfer of
a digital product to one buyer.

Due to the nature of digital products, all sales are final
and non-refundable once delivery has been completed.

All products are intended for business or professional use.
